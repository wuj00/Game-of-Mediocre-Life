# Moodimizer
----------------------------------

## Rules:

  - Not many rules...just keep clicking the spin button.
  - 2 players...so wait your turn.
  
## How to win:

  - Whoever has the most amount of money by the end of the game wins.

## Objective:

  - Here, in the game of LIFE, you will experience real-life scenarios that could either be beneficial or absolutely heartbreaking to your finances.
  - LIFE, will not allow you to move back spaces, for no one can actually go back in time and undo the mistakes of the past...that's why it's called LIFE.
  - Continuously move forward according to each roll spin until you reach the end (and hopefully the road won't be too painful).
